# jChess

Just a hobby project (that went a little too far) to get into chess programming, learn Java, server-client application programming, etc.

I precompiled the program for everyone who just wants to play. ;)

Have a look at the [version log](https://github.com/martinbroede/jChess/blob/main/version.txt) to see the most recently added features.

Hope you have fun with this â€” bug reports welcome!

Also, check out [the server](https://github.com/martinbroede/chessServer) I created for jChess so you can connect online and play against opponents of similar strength.
